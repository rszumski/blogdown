My name is Russell Szumski. I love making charts, the statistical programming language R, coffee, beer, and skeeball.

I received my BS in physics from Western Michigan University in 2011 and a MS in Mathematics form Roosevelt University in 2016. This is a sort of blog where I put stuff I created that I think is cool or that I found challenging. It could be something I came across that I wanted to recreate, a project to try out a new R package, or anything that I've done that I was proud of. 

Thanks for taking a look.
