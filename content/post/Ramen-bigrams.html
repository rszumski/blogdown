<p>A dataset of 2682 Instant Noodle Ratings was poseted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/">datasets</a> subreddit. So I created bi-grams to see how often word X is followed by word Y with names of instant ramen noodles to find any flavors and key attributes/phrases used in the names that are grouped together and appear most often. Why? Why not, who hasn’t enjoyed some instant ramen before.</p>
<p>Used <a href="https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext">tidytext</a> for the calculations and <a href="https://github.com/christophergandrud/networkD3">networkD3</a> for the visualization.</p>
<pre><code>##      word1   word2   n

<p>Looks like ramen names contain ‘instant’ and ‘noodles’ frequently, ‘cup’ is included a lot, and ‘chicken’ is a popular flavor, followed by ‘beef’.</p>
<p>Let’s visualize the bi-grams.</p>

<p>We can see the common “blueprint”&quot; of words in instant ramen names are focused around ‘noodle’, ‘noodles’, ‘instant’, ‘flavor’, and ‘chicken’.</p>
