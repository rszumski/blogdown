<p>In 2016 I trained for and ran the Chicago Marathon. During the training I was wearing a Garmin Forerunner10 watch. I recorded all the stats the watch had, then did absolutely nothing with that data. It’s two years later, so I guess I should take a look at it.</p>
<p>When I trained I didn’t follow any training program. My idea was to run a lot, I think I did that, but at this point I have no Idea. So I thought it might be fun to make a simple dashboard and have a look at what my “training” looked like. Here it is</p>

<p>A few things that stuck out:</p>
<p>-Average runs were only 5.8 miles<br />
-My longest run was about 18 miles and I did 53 days before the actual marathon<br />
-I ran for a total of 3 Days, 14 Hours, 15 Minutes and 36 Seconds<br />
-I ran the distance (562.33 miles) from Texarkana,TX to Atlanta,GA<br />
-August was my busiest month<br />
-Wednesday was my favorite day to run<br />
-My pace didn’t really change<br />
-63830 food calories seems like a lot but is apparently equivalent to about 2.2 gallons of gas</p>
