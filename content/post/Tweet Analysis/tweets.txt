An extended interview from the Super Bowl with @oreillyfactor airs tonight at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy! https://t.co/kZdHqaNTVR8058
The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories &amp; sources!19275
Will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M.6
I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!23963
Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.36259
What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!72934

Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?17863
Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision29446
What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?33272
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!66140
After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!17438
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!33518
Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death &amp; destruction!28311
When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in &amp; out, especially for reasons of safety &amp;.security - big trouble!38069
Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!27046
We must keep "evil" out of our country!44904

Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion24173

Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!20915

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!15064
"Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!12427
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!12459
It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!17458
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!17987
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!13623
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.12525

The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said7742

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.23360
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.10005
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!8264
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!8923
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.14640
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.8719

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA10427
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!8078
Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!11967
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!9475
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.9121
If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.5352
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam17329
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!7590
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!7098
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me9673
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!10029
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!5986
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!9502
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!13136
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!8118
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out5500
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild11340
The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!9400
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!7457
Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)7067
Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!9571
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!9109
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.10994
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!6644
Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!33678
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT5678
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!6739

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!6857
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!14734
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!9547
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!10316
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!8064
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!9432
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.9054
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED23961
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!8359
Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!10005
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?7467
"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"4258
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.8146
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?12935
Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.11083

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.120661
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!13165
In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!5796
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.3449
Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!6534

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.4224
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.4934
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City4292
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.3526
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!10376
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l7099
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.8445
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!7802
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!8388
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!12931
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win6073

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?21965
With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!12179
Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?10675

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!6921
In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!5705
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!6384
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."8198
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?7838
"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"10258
On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!5609
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!8721
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.9361
Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!5810
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!20984
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!12848

.@TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning. Keep up the good work!2531
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?10665
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.7841
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!5956

I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX! Enjoy!3005
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!8477
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!4998
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!5291
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD7800

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?6423
The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts4326
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!5482

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.14039

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son7150
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!6341
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.7555
George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls5327
Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!4705
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!8185
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!6731

I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying7865
I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M.4487
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!9649
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough27815
"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.9328
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.16520
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!38456
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness &amp; vigilance. We must be smart!27146
Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp; their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart &amp; vigilant?29750

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.7584
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!3707
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud3303
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.3664
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.3361
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!6525

When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.2084
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!2127

Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!2299
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?2196
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.2883
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!2348
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!2176
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable2693
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so3948

Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!934
The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!3912
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders "MASTERMINDS." Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!6526

John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!1679
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete &amp; total dud!1492
John Kasich fell right into President Obama‚Äôs trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!1503
Doesn‚Äôt help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he‚Äôs almost last.1137
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy‚Äîhe came in dead last!1179
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!1263
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!1975
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don‚Äôt want to waste my money.3042
John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!1438
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.1086
Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign &amp; debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.1046

Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".2003
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!1304
Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!2160

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?1110
Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places609
Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!20169
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!504
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot697
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!704

Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!84
ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.1314
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.851

Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One.  Doesn‚Äôt look presidential and at some point he will take a fall.544
I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone. I hear they will be doing it soon‚Äîlong overdue.306
Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March.Madness", and LEAD! Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare!562
The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST681
We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. Must be very strong to prosper &amp; survive361
I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.!577

I don't hate Obama at all, I just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history!1384
We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers, and that's OK-but how much are Russia &amp; China spending?499

No, I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! Very sad.215
"@KimStagliano: @realDonaldTrump When will NYT write about vaccine damage and its price? 3 girls w autism here, Mr. Trump." They should Kim!47
Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays.96
China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World, by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!285
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.195
"@SullyThinks: why is @realDonaldTrump not the president of the US right now?!" A very good question!72
"@thejbrain: @realDonaldTrump Very well said. The United States needs people like you to show what truly leadership means!" So true!16
"@kaiser1859: @realDonaldTrump what is the solution Mr Trump?" LEADERSHIP!35
What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea? - NOTHING!245
North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.284

Find out who and what is the best in your field. Identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities. Learn the standards they follow.363
Achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about. They have an obligation to best themselves.288
Wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. It's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.624

Haters, stop saying I went bankrupt, it is not so. I never went bankrupt...406
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.51
For the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.165
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...96
... Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!19
People buy deals &amp; immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...48
... It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.34
Why do the losers &amp; haters always say I wear a ‚Äúwig‚Äù when they know I don‚Äôt.  Like it or not, it‚Äôs all mine‚Äîjust ask Barbara Walters.700

Why do so many people say I hate President Obama‚ÄîI don‚Äôt hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!1264
@antbaxter @Salon @antbaxter‚ÄîApprentice is a huge hit all over the world. Your cheap &amp; boring documentary is a tremendous flop.30
9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last &amp; yet the Republicans lost‚Äîdo you think they might be doing something wrong!587

Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart...I hope!1019
The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.670
Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP &amp; glad I delivered keynote at their state convention.217
Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History203

China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon.2134
At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better!527
With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal.735

How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.724
Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.198

How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!694
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?346
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?876

A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama‚Äôs lack of transparency. I don't blame them.239
There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama‚Äôs choice, once he releases all of his records.352

In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.656
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.867

I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.221
The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?876

Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?746
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http://t.co/LYXCvaOl48
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?4453
@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity293
Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!872

How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?515

I never fall for scams.  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‚ÄòAli G‚Äô interview8254
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.301
My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama http://t.co/ebUofUW044
My @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm http://t.co/Lz7tTurD19
These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.497
The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.729
So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you! http://t.co/0tf8Pm0n33
The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place &amp; kept thousands of people warm &amp; safe during the storm--thanks, staff!203
Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!829
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.720
People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others, I stayed open. http://t.co/ONelqemC142
I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.381
Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.1363
Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.1532
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.1795
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.142
The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.166
All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below, move out!163
If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office.186
Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze. http://t.co/fHVEFZd9357
We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.1300
So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later.157
Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!3984

Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.950
Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was "probably" born in the US--the word "probably" is a disaster for Obama.307
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.652
What people don't know about @BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early (cont) http://t.co/EMsJd6kP161

While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.4655
.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?1983
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.588
A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.328
@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!46
@BernardMcGuirk. That's more than O'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You're terrific!5
@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly...you're terrific!5

@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But, he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will.12
I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.136

If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?146
If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!996

My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.184
Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.114
Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.30
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.747
By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah.491
...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.119
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?477
Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.292
The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!516

@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.7
@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.0
@Erizzle05  Only because he has something to hide.1
.@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!27
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain....154
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.28
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins269
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.347
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.78
"The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants." --The America We Deserve155
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.1485
Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy210
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...496
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.2287
Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants "wind turbines manufactured here in China" http://t.co/Fe2gkSlg I don't think this was a gaffe.420

In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...1314
... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.488
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.1552
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people1048

Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find &amp; put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.143

The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.287
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.51
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.15
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate17494
.@MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.915
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.140

Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous!159
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.1233
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.588
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!615
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.50145
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.222

Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.459

Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!342

Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.425

Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy.100
I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays, however.67
Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.2261

Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over 10% http://t.co/1ZISkkn9  Obama did not tell truth last night.433

Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.293
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.241
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.243
@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.9
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there.57
While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC28
Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout  http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish!146
Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary887

Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...191
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.144
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally &amp; aesthetically.201
Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.64
Remember, new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.1349
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.286

My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.6729
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!844
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.318
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!472
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!365
I still love Derek, he is a winner!96
Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot.385
At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.832
Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.74
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.168
George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.110
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows.¬†325
Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate4298
You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.2828
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.3952
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.2276
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.1762
Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.871
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.2517
Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.3686
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.5573
.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!2078
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?888
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.452
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?609
Why hasn't Obama created jobs?609
Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!423
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.74
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.263
@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!0
For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?225
Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.156
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!128
Get ready for tonight!123
@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job.10
.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.788
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.1085
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.526
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.216
.@washtimes "@BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump--'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America'" http://t.co/CcRkSlHY46

.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.45
.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.10
.@History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate41
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.198
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.13191
It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!43
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.577
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.403
.@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote &amp; make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!44
.@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent.44
I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.56
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.167
Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games48
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.832
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.321
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.208
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.122
@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday!0

If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!549
Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate http://t.co/3F5Sqe6A  Mitt should bring up college applications &amp; records251
"Romney, Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation" http://t.co/K6xUXSwa via @ABC118
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.331
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.694
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.97
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.1196
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.650
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke-¬†let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.1385
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!335
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?1055
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!254
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.476
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.372
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!820
.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.¬†679
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.79536

Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.75
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.56
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.90
.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.127
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.129
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.194
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.52
Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.¬†19
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.¬†682
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.412
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.115
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.212
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.116
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".376
I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.349
"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality." -- Warren G. Bennis684
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.685
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.215
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.39
"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy." --@PaulRyanVP210
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.348
With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL &amp; @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.14
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!26

Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate521
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate429
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate598
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate700
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate238
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate210
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate237

Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal.232
Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother http://t.co/Gfppvzc2179

If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!1583
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.62
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)86
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.409
.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer96
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.138
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal191
Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).219

I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!109
"You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird."  -- @MittRomney709
Consumer spending fell in September http://t.co/BG0U7bYz  Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked.224
A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.760
Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding http://t.co/1XB8OK2t  Do people think this is fair?465
Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.56
DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate http://t.co/nkPWyb1m What is he thinking?194
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.1876
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?490
I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.641
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again.792
"It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes." Be careful of voter fraud!643
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.144
Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!197
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.370
"I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin." -- Mitt233

Now that Obama‚Äôs poll numbers are in tailspin ‚Äì watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.637
Mitt‚Äôs subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.1442

Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.43
Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T http://t.co/QR8vZIcP  We can't afford four more years.379
Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses http://t.co/A8UyBknk Expect more massive unemployment and stagnant growth362
How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?314
Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.387

@BarackObama -- honored and excited to be listed on @AttackWatch. Thanks. BTW -- where are the jobs?   Donald.109

Oil is double the price now compared to last year--OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama.295
Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @BarackObama should answer all questions.209
The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 ‚Äì and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher.251
Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House.204
@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th. Just sad.34
My interview with @gretawire last night -- "Everything Obama Does is a 'Campaign Speech'"  http://t.co/n1M1NQc73

The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now.91
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses.483
If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood, then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences.162
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?198

@BarackObama inherited $10.6 Trillion in National Debt---will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17.6 Trillion.155
There usually is an easy solution to every problem. For instance, a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election.508

Economic growth can save Social Security, Medicare and America.154
Mike Huckebee, a great guy, said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy.185
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.1445
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.585
It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties.352
