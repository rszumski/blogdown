      <description>In 2016 I trained for and ran the Chicago Marathon. During the training I was wearing a Garmin Forerunner10 watch. I recorded all the stats the watch had, then did absolutely nothing with that data. It’s two years later, so I guess I should take a look at it.
When I trained I didn’t follow any training program. My idea was to run a lot, I think I did that, but at this point I have no Idea.</description>

      <description>I’ve been watching the 11th season of The X-Files and it got me thinking about UFOs. In my search for data on UFO sightings I came across a dataset on Kaggle that has 80,000+ documented close encounters from the past 70 years. I also came across a R package called dygraphs, for charting time-series data, and the three.js package, that has globejs: a somewhat silly widget that plots data and images on a 3-d globe.</description>
